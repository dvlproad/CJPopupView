  "description": "*、CJPhotoBrowser：自定义的“图片浏览器CJPhotoBrowser”\n\n A longer description of CJPhotoBrowser in Markdown format.\n\n * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!",
